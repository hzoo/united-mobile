For this assignment, build a working proof of concept for a redesign of united.com's mobile app.

This app should:

a. Allow the user to log in and for the app to display their name
b. Allow the user to find their boarding pass on their phone in the security line and have it available by the time they are in front of the TSA agent.

An html page written to simulate a mobile experience would be sufficient.
It is also perfectly acceptable to use hard coded, “dummy” data.
